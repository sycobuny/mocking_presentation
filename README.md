Mocking Code
============

What did code ever do to you?
-----------------------------

This repo holds various information used to build my presentation on mocking
code for testing. It's a quick intro to the idea of mocking code, and is being
presented at the [Baltimore.pm][bpm] meetup in September 2012.

 * See [This article][art] for a lengthy discussion of mocking.
 * See [Test::MockObject][tmo] for more on a full mocking setup.
 * See [DBD::Mock][dbdm] for a mocking system for databases.
